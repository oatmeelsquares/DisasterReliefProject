Notes on our project:

- include shift to binary poblem in EDA
- don't say definitely 50% will be a bad threshold
- larger K is simpler
- add titles to patchwork graphs

- what does performance difference betwen LDA and QDA tell you about the data? (Conclusion 3)
- add zooming to ROC curves







The report is well written and has a good flow.
Expand the EDA and the conclusions.
I appreciate that you combined the writeup of log-reg and penalized log-reg. This is the first time Iâ€™ve seen that. 

- Formatting:
    o Well written and organized. 

- Coding:
    o Consistent approach 
    o Focus on relevant information 
    o Avoid hard-coding results (e.g. thresholds in line 649), use variables for this. You can also reference variables in the text, but try to use them at least inside the code blocks.

- EDA:
    o Add EDA that supports the binary classification model. 

- Methodology:
    o Selection of k value for kNN using one-standard-deviation rule is the wrong way round. 

- Conclusions:
    o The conclusions can be a bit more specific.#

Notes (ideas) from class:

 - data visualization:
    o over plotting: smaller points, density plots, heatmaps
    o density plots are prettier than boxplots and give more information
- reduce memory size of plots: #| dev: png, #| dpi: 300
- log transform y to lessen dispersion, especially for LDA
- percentage of each component as part of the overall color
- use a different color scale model (HSL)
- tuning:
    o regular grid for one parameter
    o random/hypercube grid for multiple parameters
- zoom in on roc curves coord.cartesian (not xlim, ylim)
- gains charts in threshold selection
